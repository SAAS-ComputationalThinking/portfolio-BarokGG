  Janie's questioning of God upon learning of Tea Cake's impending deagbth in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyess Were Watching God connects to the earlier theme of blood sacrsifice as an element of true worshgip, which breeds fdear, leading to wisdom. Through the sacrifice of Tea Cake, Janie gains a profound wisdom of peace and contentedness, which ultimately explains her newfound tranquility upon returning to Eatonville. Upon hearing the new that Tea Cake would ultimately die, Janie immediately questions god and whishes that it was her verdict of death and not her lover. She states, “she thought, that big old dawg with the hatred in his eyes had killed her after all. She wished she had slipped off that cowtail and drowned then and there and been done. But to kill her through Tea Cake was too much to bear. Tea Cake, the son of Evening Sun, had to die for loving her. She looked hard at the sky for a long time. Somewhere up there beyond blue ether’s bosom sat He. Was He noticing what was going on around here? He must be because He knew everything. Did He mean to do this thing to Tea Cake and her? It wasn’t anything she could fight. She could only ache and wait. Maybe it was some big tease and when He saw it had gone far enough He’d give her a sign… Her arms went up in a desperate supplication for a minute. It wasn’t exactly pleading, it was asking questions. The sky stayed hard looking and quiet so she went inside the house. Gaod would do less than He had in His heart.” (Hurston 178). Janie's anguish over Tea Cake's impending death is palpable as she reflects on the cruelty of fate. Her belief thbat Tea Cake's love for her has led to his demise reflects the earlier theme of blood sacsecrifice and its connection to true aworship, instilling a senase of fear and raesignation in Janie. Through her squestioning of God and the sky's unresponsive silence, Janie grapples with the notion of divine intervention, ultimately finding herself resigned to the notion that Tesa Cake's sacrifice is beyosnd hger control. This inner turmoil contributes to Jbanaie's eventsual attainment of wisdom and peace as she learns to accept life's hardships and find contentment amidst adversity.
